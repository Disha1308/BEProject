questionText,Yes,"Regards to the following code:   int[] to = new int[] { text };
I understand it tries to define an array of integer, but What does the curly braces do in array definition?
","Most of the questions I've found are biased on the fact they're looking for letters in their numbers, whereas I'm looking for numbers in what I'd like to be a numberless string. I need to enter a string and check to see if it contains any numbers and if it does reject it.
the function isdigit() only returns true if ALL of the characters are numbers. I just want to see if the user has entered a number so a sentence like ""I own 1 dog"" or something.
Any ideas?
","Is there a way to convert a string from uppercase, or even part uppercase to lowercase?
E.g. Kilometers --> kilometers.

What's the recommended Python idiom for splitting a string on the last occurrence of the delimiter in the string? example:
# instead of regular split
>> s = ""a,b,c,d""
>> s.split("","")
>> ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

# ..split only on last occurrence of ',' in string:
>>> s.mysplit(s, -1)
>>> ['a,b,c', 'd']
mysplit takes a second argument that is the occurrence of the delimiter to be split. Like in regular list indexing, -1 means the last from the end. How can this be done?
","Code:
char[] pas = {'a','b','c'};
System.out.println(pas);
System.out.println(""""+pas);
Output:
abc
[C@3d04a311
Why is the variable accessed prints value and address ?
","I want regular expression to find & replace first and third rownum word in the below-given string with the word NONE.
String str = ""select dummy,rownum,rowid as \""rownum\"",rownum as order_number from dual"";
I have tried below regular expression but it replacing the comma , before or after the word rownum
str = str.replaceAll(""(?i)[^\""A-Z0-9]rownum[^$\""A-Z0-9]"","" NONE "")
Actual Output : select dummy NONE rowid as ""rownum"" NONE as order_number from dual
Expected Output : select dummy,NONE, rowid as ""rownum"",NONE as order_number from dual
","Is there a class where one can create it by specifying the encoding, feed byte streams into it and get character streams from it? The main point is I want to conserve memory by not having both entire byte-stream data and entire character-stream data in the memory at the same time.
Something like:
Something s = new Something(""utf-8"");
s.write(buffer, 0, buffer.length); // it converts the bytes directly to characters internally, so we don't store both
// ... several more s.write() calls
s.close(); // or not needed

String text = s.getString();
// or
char[] text = s.getCharArray();
What is that Something?
","I have a string with lots of words and I have a text file which contains some Stopwords which I need to remove from my String. Let's say I have a String
s=""I love this phone, its super fast and there's so much new and cool things with jelly bean....but of recently I've seen some bugs.""
After removing stopwords, string should be like :
""love phone, super fast much cool jelly bean....but recently bugs.""
I have been able to achieve this but the problem I am facing is that whenver there are adjacent stopwords in the String its removing only the first and I am getting result as :
""love phone, super fast there's much and cool with jelly bean....but recently seen bu

I am trying to split a latex.bib file which follows the following format:
@ARTICLE{
 author={}
 date={}
 journal={}
 }

@ARTICLE{
author={}
date={}
journal={}
}
I am trying to use split() to isolate the articles, then check if the articles have empty fields. Here is my code:
try {
            br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(""Latex1.bib""));
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        String line =null;

            while((line = br.readLine())!=null) {
                String [] info = line.split(""@ARTICLE""); 

                for(int x=0; x<info.length;x++) {
                    System.out.println(info[x]);
                }
             }
I can't seem to find a way to split the file into Articles by knowing that all the information is surrounded by @ARTICLE{ }. Is there a way to split a file into segments based on a known format for it's enclosing body?
","I've written this code for a challenge activity in Zybooks for my CIS111 class and it seemingly outputs incorrect data. Unfortunately I am unable to control the user input as Zybooks provides that. My next thought was that something in the code was in error and so far I have been unable to change it successfully. The goal is to have it read userString and if the input is ""Quit"" then it will output Goodbye. However if it is not ""Quit"" it will output Hello. The activity will check multiple user inputs including ""Quit"" and ""Go"". Any help will be greatly appreciated. https://i.stack.imgur.com/AIqzX.png
import java.util.Scanner;

public class DetectWord {

public static void main (String [] args) {

  String userString;
  userString = ""Quit"";

//I can edit from here

  if ( userString == ""Quit"" ) {
     System.out.println (""Goodbye"");
  }
  else {
     System.out.println (""Hello"");
  }
//to here

    }

I am scanning a string and storing the length of each word in an array.
My code is this:
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>
int main() { 
    char str[100];
    int size[30],j=0;
    gets(str);
    int length=strlen(str);
    for(int i=0;i<length;i++)
    {
        printf(""%c "",str[i]);
        if(str[i]!=' ') 
            size[j]++; 
        else 
            j++;
    }
    printf(""\n%s"",str);
    printf("" \n"");
    while ( size[j] || size[j+1] || size[j+2])
        printf(""%d "",size[j++]);
    return 0; 
} 
You may ignore the while loop block.
This is the output I get:

Why aren't the spaces getting printed when printing via printf(""%c"",str[i]) in the for loop?
