Whats the recommended Python idiom for splitting a string on the last occurrence of the delimiter in the string? example:
# instead of regular split
>> s = """"a,b,c,d""""
>> s.split("""","""")
>> [ a , b, c, d]
# ..split only on last occurrence of "","" in string:
>>> s.mysplit(s, -1)
>>> [""a,b,c"", ""d""]
mysplit takes a second argument that is the occurrence of the delimiter to be split. Like in regular list indexing, -1 means the last from the end. How can this be done?",0,"2018-03-23 10:00:00","Splitting on last delimiter in Python string?","5"
